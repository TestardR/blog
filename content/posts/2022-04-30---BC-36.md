##  Factory Method

Factory Method is a creational deisgn pattern that provides an interface for created objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Structure

### Code

```
from __future__ import annotations
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class Creator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def factory_method(self):
        pass

    def some_operation(self) -> str:
        product = self.factory_method()
        return product.operation()


class ConcreteCreator1(Creator):
    def factory_method(self) -> Product:
        return ConcreteProduct1()


class ConcreteCreator2(Creator):
    def factory_method(self) -> Product:
        return ConcreteProduct2()


class Product(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def operation(self) -> str:
        pass


class ConcreteProduct1(Product):
    def operation(self) -> str:
        return "{Result of the ConcreteProduct1}"


class ConcreteProduct2(Product):
    def operation(self) -> str:
        return "{Result of the ConcreteProduct2}"

```
