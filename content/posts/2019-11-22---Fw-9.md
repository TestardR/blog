This article was done using my notes from Sudheer Jonna, 2020, [React Interview Questions & Answers](https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions#what-is-react).

## What is JSX ?

JSX is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym stands for JavaScript XML). Basically it just provides syntactic sugar for the React.createElement() function, giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template syntax.

In the example below text inside <h1> tag return as JavaScript function to the render function.

```
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return(
      <div>
        <h1>{'Welcome to React world!'}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
