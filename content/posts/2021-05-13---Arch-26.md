This article was done using my notes from Harry Perical and Bob Gregory (2020).

### Encapsulation and Abstractions

The term encapsulation covers two closely related ideas: simplifying behavior and hiding data.
We encapsulate behavior by identifying a task that needs to be done in our code and giving that task to a well-defined object or function. We call that object or function an abstraction.

#### Before encapsulation and abstraction 
```
import json
from urllib.request import urlopen 
from urllib.parse import urlencode

params = dict(q='Sausages', format='json')
handle = urlopen('http://api.test.com' + '?' +
urlencode(params))
raw_text = handle.read().decode('utf8')

results = json.loads(raw_text)
```

#### After encapsulation and abstraction 
```
import requests
params = dict(q='Sausages', format='json')

results = requests.get('http://api.test.com/',
params=params).json()
```

Both code listings do the same thing: they submit form-encoded values to a URL to use test API.
But the second is simpler to read and understand because it operates at a higher level of abstraction.
