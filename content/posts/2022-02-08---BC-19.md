## Transactions

Dealing with databases, transactions gives us a clear understanding things that happened versus thing that did not happen. 

### ACID properties

**A - Atomicity**: Each transaction is all or nothing.

**C - Consistency**: Any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another (Foreign key constraints).

**I - Isolation**: Executing transactions concurrently has the same results as if the transactions were executed serially.

**D - Durability**: Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so.

### Isolation

When maintaining isolation, a DBMS usually acquires locks on data which may result in a loss of concurrency. Most DBMSs offer [a number of transaction isolation levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)#Isolation_levels), which control the degree of locking that occurs when selecting data. 

For many database applications, the majority of database transactions can be constructed to avoid requiring high isolation levels (e.g. SERIALIZABLE level), thus reducing the locking overhead for the system.
