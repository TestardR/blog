## Open-Closed Principle

"A software artifact should be open for extension but closed for modification."

Applied to architecture, OCP thrives to make the system easy to extend without incurring a high impact of change. This goal is accomplished by partitioning the system into components, and arranging those components into a dependency hierarchy that protects higher-level components from changes in lower-level components.

OCP recommends to build components unidirectional relationships. As you can see from the graph, all arrows point toward the components that we want to protect. As such, changes in lower-level components will not imply changes in higher-level components.
