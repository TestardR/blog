This article was done using my notes from [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#CharacteristicsOfAMicroserviceArchitecture) (2014) and [Romana Gnatyk](https://www.n-ix.com/microservices-vs-monolith-which-architecture-best-choice-your-business/) (2018).

## Microservices as an architecture

According to Martin Fowler, "In short, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.".

As Romana Gnatyk explains, while a monolithic application is a single unified unit, a microservices architecture breaks it down into a collection of smaller independent units.These units carry out every application process as a separate service.

Each service covers its own scope and can be updated, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Strengths and weaknesses

Here is a useful list of nicely picked strengths and weaknesses by Romana Gnatyk.

### Strengths

#### 1. Independent components

All the services can be deployed and updated independently, which gives more flexibility. Secondly, a bug in one microservice has an impact only on a particular service and does not influence the entire application. Also, it is much easier to add new features to a microservice application than a monolithic one.

#### 2. Easier understanding

Split up into smaller and simpler components, a microservice application is easier to understand and manage. You just concentrate on a specific service that is related to a business goal you have.

#### 3. Better scalability

each element can be scaled independently. So the entire process is more cost- and time-effective than with monoliths when the whole application has to be scaled even if there is no need in it.

#### 3. Flexibility in choosing the technology

The engineering teams are not limited by the technology chosen from the start. They are free to apply various technologies and frameworks for each microservice.

#### 4. The higher level of agility.

Any fault in a microservices application affects only a particular service and not the whole solution. So all the changes and experiments are implemented with lower risks and fewer errors.

### Weaknesses

#### 1. Extra complexity

Since a microservices architecture is a distributed system, you have to choose and set up the connections between all the modules and databases. Also, as long as such an application includes independent services, all of them have to be deployed independently.

#### 2. Cross-cutting concerns

When creating a microservices application, you will have to deal with a number of cross-cutting concerns. They include externalized configuration, logging, metrics, health checks, and others.

#### 3. Testing

A multitude of independently deployable components makes testing a microservices-based solution much harder.

## Is a microservices architecture what you need ? 

You should go for a microservices arhictecture if you match the followings: 


1. Microservices expertise: Without proper skills and knowledge, building a microservice application is extremely risky. Still, just having the architecture knowledge is not enough. You need to have DevOps and Containers experts since the concepts are tightly coupled with microservices. Also, domain modelling expertise is a must. Dealing with microservices means splitting the system into separate functionalities and dividing responsibilities.

2. A complex and scalable application: The microservices architecture will make scaling and adding new capabilities to your application much easier. So if you plan to develop a large application with multiple modules and user journeys, a microservice pattern would be the best way to handle it.

3. Enough engineering skills: Since a microservice project comprises multiple teams responsible for multiple services, you need to have enough resources to handle all the processes.
