##  Command

Command pattern turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.

### Structure

![Command](/media/architecture/command-pattern.png)

### Code

```
package main

import "fmt"

type Button struct {
	command Command
}

func (b *Button) press() {
	b.command.execute()
}

type Command interface {
	execute()
}

type OnCommand struct {
	device Device
}

func (c *OnCommand) execute() {
	c.device.on()
}

type OffCommand struct {
	device Device
}

func (c *OffCommand) execute() {
	c.device.off()
}

type Device interface {
	on()
	off()
}

type Tv struct {
	isRunning bool
}

func (t *Tv) on() {
	t.isRunning = true
	fmt.Println("Turning tv on")
}

func (t *Tv) off() {
	t.isRunning = false
	fmt.Println("Turning tv off")
}

func main() {
	tv := &Tv{}

	onCommand := &OnCommand{
		device: tv,
	}

	offCommand := &OffCommand{
		device: tv,
	}

	onButton := &Button{
		command: onCommand,
	}
	onButton.press()

	offButton := &Button{
		command: offCommand,
	}
	offButton.press()
}
```
