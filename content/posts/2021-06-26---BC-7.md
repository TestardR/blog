## Single Responsability Principle

"A module should be responsible to one, and only one, actor.".
A module should be understood as a source file while an actor should be understood as a group of users or stakeholders who wants the system to change in the same way.

### Separate code that supports different actors

By putting these three methods into a single Employee class, the developers have coupled each of these actors to the others. This coupling can cause the actions of the CFO’s team to affect something that the COO’s team depends on.

These problems occur because we put code that different actors depend on into close proximity. The SRP says to separate the code that different actors depend on.

Move the coupled functions into different classes.
