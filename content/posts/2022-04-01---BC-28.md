## Deployment

### Independence

Microservice deployment should allow the release of one service independently from another. Even though not mandatory, having a single repository per microservice with its dedicated CI build to deploy them independently has grown to become an industry standard.

## Automation

A culture of automation is key to manage microservices. Moving towards single-service per container, which technologies such as Docker will make automation easier. Also using Cloud Platforms, such as AWS, will give again huge benefits towards automation.

## Self-service-deploy

Creating tools that let developers self-service-deploy any given service into a number of different environments is really important.
