## List Slicing with [::]

Slicking is commonly used to access ranges of elements within an ordered collection. Slicing uses the **[]** indexing synthax with the following **[start:stop:step]** pattern. 

```
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

list[1:3:1] // [2, 3]
```

Adding the **[1:3:1]** index returned a slice of the original list ranging
from index 1 to index 2, with a step size of one element. It is important to remember that the upper bound is always exclusive.

### Stride

A stride is a sublist that includes every other element of the original.

```
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

list[::2] // [1, 3, 5]
```

### Reverse

```
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

list[::-1] // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

We asked Python to give us the full list (::), but to go over all of the
elements from back to front by setting the step size to -1.

### Clear

You can use the **:** operator to clear
all elements from a list without destroying the list object itself.

```
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
del list[:]

list // []
```

### Shallow copy

Creating a shallow copy means that only the structure of the elements
is copied, not the elements themselves.

```
list = ['a','b', 'c', 'd']
copied_list = list[:] 

copied_list // ['a','b', 'c', 'd'] 
copied_list is list // False
```
