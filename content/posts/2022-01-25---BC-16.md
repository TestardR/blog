## Rolling upgrade

If we want to release rolling upgrades into production. We would have a load balancer, which would direct a small amount of traffic to the code we want to deploy. This is where we can validate that the upgrade is working fine, before rolling out to the rest of the users. We call it canary deployment. It is a deployment strategy that releases an application or service incrementally to a subset of users (harness, 2022).

How does a user get a consistent experience with this kind of deployment strategy ?

## Code compatibility

**Backward Compatibility**: Newer code can read data that was written by older code for old and new clients.

**Forward Compatibility**: Older code can read data that was written by newer code for new and old clients.

In general, data is not stored in plain text. It is stored in encoded manner. Each encoded data stores are schemas associated to them. So to deploy in an agile manner, we need to understand how data is encoded and how backward-forward compatibility comes into play.

## Encoding/Decoding

When data is sent across the wire from one service to another, the data is converted into an a set of bytes which are optimized for transport, read, and storage. It is also known as serialization or unmarshalling. The opposite process of decoding is also known as deserialization or unmarshalling.

Famous human encoding mechanisms are JSON, CSV, XML. However, they take a lot of space.
Binary encoding are lighter solutions but lose the ability to be read by humans. Binary encoding varies in parsing strategies and size performance. Examples are Protocol Buffer or even Avro.

Each encoding strategy has various optimization, advantages and drawbacks. It is very important to know what encoder supports in terms of backward and forward compatibility to maintain flowless rolling upgrades.
