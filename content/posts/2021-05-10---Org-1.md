This article was done using my notes from Saurav Omar (2019).

### Conway's Law

Conway (1968) coined what has come to be known as Conway's law:
"Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure".

This basically means that the style of code (or services you built ) should reflect the way the people and teams in your company communicate or produce software architectures matching their current structure.

### Inverse Conway Law's

In the time of less dependent service (or separation of concern) techies came up with Inverse Converse Law’s.

Saurav Omar (2019) summarizes befinits as such:

1. Reverse Logic is structuring your system into independent, self-contained services so that teams can work independently,
2. Microservices architectures aim to increase velocity, so they apply Conway’s law in reverse to structure the system to achieve this goal,
3. Reverse Logic follows to create fewer dependencies and can grow faster as compared to Conway Law,
4. Teams only focus on what they building and how they communicate with other pieces of code or microservices.
