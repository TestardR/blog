## The Interface Segregation Principle

The principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
ISP splits interfaces that are very large into smaller and more specific ones so that clients will only have to know about the methods that are of interest to them.

### Typical violation

![ISP](/media/ISP.png)

Let’s assume that User1 uses only op1, User2 uses only op2, and User3 uses only op3.
The source code of User1 will inadvertently depend on op2 and
op3 , even though it doesn’t call them. This dependence means that a change
to the source code of op2 in OPS will force User1 to be recompiled and
redeployed, even though nothing that it cared about has actually changed.

### Segregation of operations into interfaces

Now, the source code of User1 will depend on U1Ops , and op1 , but
will not depend on OPS . Thus a change to OPS that User1 does not care
about will not cause User1 to be recompiled and redeployed.

### ISP and architecture

Consider, for example, an architect working on a system, S. He wants to
include a certain framework, F, into the system. Now suppose that the
authors of F have bound it to a particular database, D. So S depends on F.
which depends on D.

Now suppose that D contains features that F does not use and, therefore, that
S does not care about. Changes to those features within D may well force the
redeployment of F and, therefore, the redeployment of S.
