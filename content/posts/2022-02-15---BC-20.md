## Troubles with Distributed System

### Distributed systems benefits

1. Scaling: microservices are easier to scale than monolith. Though, monolith can still be scaled vertically, but a hardware will apply,
2. Cost: you can scale up using commidity hardware while staying away from custom configuration,
3. Geolocation: you can reduce latency having your services run on machines close to your users.

### Distributed systems caveats

1. Unreliable clocks: Clocks synchronization across services is crucial among services,
2. Process pauses: Machines can stop for many reasons, heart beat checks are crucial to the fault tolerance of the system,
3. Network: Microservices communicate through network. Network availability is as the base foundation of distributed systems.
