## The Liskov Substitution Principle

The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. 

### Guiding the use of inheritance

Imagine that we have a class named License. This class has a method named calcFee() , which is called by the Billing application. There are two “subtypes” of License : PersonalLicense and BusinessLicense. They use different algorithms to calculate the license fee.

This design conforms to the LSP because the behavior of the Billing
application does not depend, in any way, on which of the two subtypes it
uses. Both of the subtypes are substitutable for the License type.

The canonical example of a violation of the LSP is the famed square/rectangle problem

The Rectangle subclass is not substitutable for the Square class. The User class depends on both types implementation, which goes against LSP.

### LSP and Architecture

Over the years the LSP has morphed into a broader principle of
software design that pertains to interfaces and implementations. These well-defined interfaces allow for the implemention of subtitutable services. 

However, not respecting interface contracts would lead to exceptions. Indeed, the same as at the code level, at an architecture level, special cases would have to be handled if the interfaces are not respected.

A simple violation of substitutability, can cause a system's architecture to be polluted.
