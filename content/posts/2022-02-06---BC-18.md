## Database Paritioning

Overall data partitioning, sharding, splitting or, bucketing, is the same. It is basically saying "certain users will go to certain machines that are backed by certain databases". 

### Why do we need database partitioning ?

The reason behing partitioning is scalability. If you have millions of users and lots of data per user, then one machine cannot solve it. You need multiple machines with partitions. 

Several things to watch out for:
1. Hot-spots / Hot-skews due to unbalanced distribution of data
2. Key-hash based partition for balanced distribution of data

### How does partitionning impact index ?

The changes brought to a database has to propagate to the secondary index. Secondary index can be local, this index will maintain at partition level index (optimized for writes, but not for reads). However secondary global index will be maintained across partitions (optimized for reads, but not for writes).

### How does request routing work ?
