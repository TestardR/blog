## The Dependency Inversion Principle

DIP tells us that the most flexible systems are those in which source code dependencies refer only to
abstractions, not to concretions.

It is the volatile concrete elements of our system that we want to avoid depending on. Those are the modules that we are actively developing, and that are undergoing frequent change.

## Stable Abstractions

Every change to an abstract interface corresponds to a change to its concrete implementations. Conversely, changes to concrete implementations do not always, or even usually, require changes to the interfaces that they implement.
Therefore interfaces are less volatile than implementations.

The implication, then, is that stable software architectures are those that avoid depending on volatile concretions, and that favor the use of stable abstract interfaces.
