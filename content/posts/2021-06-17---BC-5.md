## From polymorphism to dependency inversion

According to Robert C. Martin, we can give Object-Oriented Programming a clear definition. OO is the ability, through the use of polymorphism, to gain absolute control over every source code dependency in the system. That is to say, we implement dependency inversion.

It allows the architect to create a plugin architecture, in which modules that contain high-level policies are independent of modules that contain low-level details.

The low-level details are relegated to plugin modules that can be deployed and developed independently from the modules that contain high-level policies.
