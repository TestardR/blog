## Data-Intensive application

An application is the data intensive if the amount of data that it generates/uses increases quickly or if the complexity of data that it generates/uses increases quickly or if the speed of change in data increases quickly. 

## Components of data intensive application

Main components in a data-intensive applications include:
1. **Databases** for source of truth for any consumer. E.g. Oracle/MySQL
2. **Cache** for temporarily storing an expensive operation to speed up reads. E.g. Memcache
3. **Full-text Index** for quickly searching data by keyword or filter.e.g. Apache Lucene
4. **Message queues** for messaging passing between process. E.g. Apache Kafka
5. **Stream processing**. E.g. Apache Samza, Apache Spark
6. **Batch processing** for crunching large amount of data. E.g. Apache Spark/Hadoop
7. **Application code** which acts as the connective tissue between the above components.

### Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable

Role of an application developer is to design the data system for reliability, scalability and maintainability. 

**Reliability** is fault tolerance from human, software or hardware faults. The system can ensure there is no unauthorized access to systems, output is as per expectation and performance is good enough for the application to be usable. Deliberately doing Chaos testing helps with finding out issues. Automating tests and staging/testing environment needs to present.
Bugs need to be fixed and caught at a much earlier phase and thus system needs to be testable and monitorable. There needs to be a way to quickly roll-back when failure happens. 

**Scalability** ensures the system can grow with higher traffic volume and complexity of new systems get added. Capacity planning is part of scalability and it is best to plan for capacity uplift regularly. Online systems care more about response time, offline systems are mainly around throughput. Remember end user response time includes your server response time + a lot of network in between. Monitoring for both system performance and perceived performance is thus quite critical. There are two major scaling techniques: scaling up (more powerful machine), scaling out (distributed many smaller machines). 

**Maintainability** ensures that as we add new people to work on the software that productivity is not impacted for developers. There are three questions you can ask to check if your systems are maintainable: 
1. Operable: Is it easy to get system up and running and monitor system health ? 
Configurable and testable systems are easy to operate and maintain. 
2. Simple: Is it easy to understand and ramp up on this system ?  
Using good design patterns and having good documentation and clean code helps new people ramp up quickly. 
3. Evolveable: Is it easy to change the system for issues and add new features ?
Refactor code regularly to make abstractions easier to understand and remove unintended code debt regularly.
