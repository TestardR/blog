This article was done using my notes from Kate Matsudaira (2013).

## Building blocks of fast and scalable data access

As applications grow, there are two main challenges: scaling access to the app server and to the database.

Let’s assume you have many terabytes (TB) of data and you want to allow users to access small portions of that data at random. You might consider using memory but it can be very costly to load TBs of data into it. Furthermore, reading from disk is many times slower than from memory. Moreover, even with unique IDs, solving the problem of knowing where to find that little bit of data can be an arduous task.

Indexes are one of the options you have to make this issue easier to deal with.

### Indexes

Using an index to access your data quickly is a well-known strategy for optimizing data access performance; probably the most well known when it comes to databases. An index makes the trade-offs of increased storage overhead and slower writes (since you must both write the data and
update the index) for the benefit of faster reads.

#### Indexes as a table of contents

An index can be used like a table of contents that directs you to the location where your data lives. For example, let’s say you are looking for a piece of data, part 2 of B—how will you know where to find it? If you have an index that is sorted by data type—say data A, B, C—it would tell
you the location of data B at the origin. Then you just have to seek to that location and read the part of B you want.

#### Intermediate indexes

Indexes can also be used to create several different views of the same data. For large data sets, this is a great way to define different filters and sorts without resorting to creating many additional copies of the data.

Creating these intermediate indexes and representing the data in smaller sections makes big data problems tractable. Data can be spread across many servers and still accessed quickly. Indexes are a cornerstone of information retrieval, and the basis for today’s modern search engines.
