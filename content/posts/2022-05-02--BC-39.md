##  Adapter

Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

### Structure

![Adapter](/media/architecture/adapter-pattern.png)

### Code

```
class Target:
    def request(self) -> str:
        return "Target: The default target's behavior."


class Adaptee:
    def specific_request(self) -> str:
        return "Special request."


class Adapter(Target, Adaptee):
    def request(self) -> str:
        return f"Adapter: (TRANSLATED) {self.specific_request()}"
```
