This article was done using my notes from Sean Maxwell, 2018, "TypeScript Object-Oriented Concepts in a Nutshell".

## Object Overview

Objects are instances of classes. Think of classes as just a group methods and variables. Let’s say we wanted to have a program called PetStore that only sells cats and dogs. A **dog** could have attributes like **age** and **breed** but also methods like **getRelativeAge**, if we want the age in dog years. If we’re talking about a particular dog object such as **Spot** or **Bingo**, who have values set for their attributes, then those objects are instances of the **Dog class**.

Classes are implemented using the **class** keyword, just like in ES6. To create an object we call the class with the **new** keyword, which triggers the constructor and returns an instance-object just like in regular JavaScript.

Spot is an instance-object of Dog:

```
class Dog {

    age: number
    breed: string

    constructor(age: number, breed: string) {

        this.age = age
        this.breed = string
    }

    getRelativeAge(): number {

        return this.age * 7
    }

}

let Spot = new Dog(2, 'Labrador')
```

Equivalent using function-objects in pre-ES6:

```
function Dog(age, breed) {

    this.age = age
    this.breed = breed

}

Dog.prototype.getRelativeAge = function() {

    return this.age * 7

}

var Spot = new Dog(2, 'Labrador')
```

## Object inheritance

In our PetStore program, we’re selling dogs and cats but there could be different breeds of dogs and cats right? Also dogs and cats might share some of the same attributes like **age** and **weight**. **Super** classes, (aka parent classes) allow for related objects to be grouped together so that they can inherit similar attributes. To inherit from a parent classes we use the **extends** keyword. When you extend a class, all attributes and methods with be passed down. We can now just expand upon a parent **Animal** class. Multi-level inheritance is also possible by extending child classes.

The **super** keyword allows to access method (but NOT attributes) of the parent object.

Animal is the parent class of Dog:

```
class Animal {

    age: number
    breed: string

    constructor(age: number, breed: string) {

        this.age = age

        this.breed = breed

    }

    makeSound(sound: string): void {

        console.log(sound)

    }

}
```

Basic inheritance using super:

```
class Dog extends Animal {

    playsFetch: boolean

    constructor(age: number, breed: string, playsFetch: boolean) {

         super(age, breed) // call parent constructor

         this.playsFetch = playsFetch

    }

    makeSound(): void {

        super.makeSound('woof woof')

    }

    getAgeInHumanYears(): number {

        return this.age * 7    // super.age will throw error

    }

}
```

## Access-Control

Access-control refers to where we can use a class’s attributes and methods.
You might have noticed keywords like public, private, and protected. Let’s go over what each one of these is for and why they are useful.

Suppose our PetStore program has a class named Animal. If we don't want our Dog instance to directly access eyes and legs. We should set them as **private**. It works on method as well.

```
class Animal {

    private eyes: number,
    private legs: number

  constructor() {
      this.eyes = eyes,
      this.legs = legs

  }

  run(): void {

    console.log(`Speed is ${this.legs}`);

  }

}

class Dog extends Animal {}

let fido = new Dog(2, 10);

fido.run();

```

**protected** means that a variable/method can only be accessed in child classes of the parent or the class itself. We shouldn’t be able to access that method externally on any class that inherits from animal or animal itself because not animals make sounds.

```
class Animal {

  protected makeSound(sound: string): void {

    console.log(sound);

  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {

  makeSound(): void {

    super.makeSound('woof woof');

  }

}

let an = new Animal();

 an.makeSound('grow'); // Not allowed

let dog: Dog = new Dog();

dog.makeSound(); // 'Woof woof'

```

## static and readonly

If we want to access a property on a **class** without having to go through the trouble of returning an instance-object (calling the object with new), then we can mark it as **static** and it will be set on the class (function-object) itself.

```
class Dog {

 static species = 'Hulsky';

 age = 10;

}

const printSpecies = () => {

 console.log(Dog.species); // 'Hulsky'

 console.log(Dog.age); // undefined
};

printSpecies();

```

The **readonly** keyword is pretty self-explanatory. It’s used for class level variables and means that the value cannot be reassigned. Values that are initialized when the class is created and you know are never going to change should be readonly. Our Dog class’s species property is a good example.

```
class Dog {

 static readonly species = 'Hulsky';

 age = 10;

}

const printSpecies = () => {

 console.log(Dog.species); // 'Hulsky'

};

printSpecies();

```

## Interfaces

Whenever we want to say that an object being passed has a specific set of attributes, we can use an interface.

```
export interface GpsListener {

  location(): void;

}

export class Animal implements GpsListener {

  constructor(private legs: number, protected eyes: number) {}


  location() {

    console.log('sending location');

  }

}

let an = new Animal(1, 2);
an.location(); // Sending location

```

## Abstract classes and methods

Abstract classes define attributes for other classes like interfaces do, but some of their methods may contain implementation unlike interfaces. A method without implementation must be marked **abstract**, and so must its containing object. Abstract classes may not be instantiated (can’t use new) and useful for when you know you’ll never need the parent class directly.

```
abstract class Animal {

    protected age: number

    abstract getRelativeAge(): number;

}

class Dog extends Animal {

    getRelativeAge(): number {

        return this.age * 7

    }

}

class Cat extends Animal {

    getRelativeAge(): number {

        return this.age * 6

    }
}
```
