This article was done using my notes from Stephen Grider's amazing course on algorithms and data structures, available at : https://www.rallycoding.com/

## The Fibonnacie series

Create a function that prints the n-th entry in the fibonacci series.
The fibonacci series is an ordering of numbers where each number is the sum of the preceeding two.

For example, the sequence [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34] forms the first ten entries of the fibonacci series.<br>

For example:<br>
fib(4) === 3;

```
Solution 1:

function fib(n) {

    // let's set an array and hardcode the first two values
    // we can't compute them as they don't have n-2 and n-1 values.
    const result = [0, 1];

    // we want to start our loop from the third value in our array
    // as the two previous one are already computed
    for (let i = 2; i <=n ; i++) {

        const a = result[n - 1];
        const b = result[n - 2];

        // lets add to our array the next fibonnaci number
        result.push(a + b);
    }

    return result[n];
}
```

```
Solution 2:

function fib(n) {
    // as the first two values are 0 and 1
   if(n < 2) return n;

    // use recursion to obtain the fibonnaci number
   return fib(n -1) + fib(n - 2);

}

// This solution is not efficient. Its time complexity is exponential.
// The higher is n, the greater is the number of function calls it has to run to come
// with the right answer.

```

As a mean to drastically decrease time/complexity, we can implement what is known as "memoization".

Memoization consists in storing the arguments of each function call along with the result. If the function is called again with the same arguments,
it will return the precomputed result, rather than running the function again.

```
Solution 3:

function slowFib(n) {
    // as the first two values are 0 and 1
   if(n < 2) return n;

    // use recursion to obtain the fibonnaci number
   return slowFib(n -1) + slowFib(n - 2);

}

function memoize(fn) {

    // store calls and respective results
    const cache = {};

    // faster function, we use the spread operator in case we receive multiple arguments
    // the arguments will be assigned as an array to this function
    return function(...args) {

        // if a result has already been registered, return it
        if(cache[args]) {
            return cache[args];
        }

        // whenever we call another function receiving an array, we have to use apply
        const result = fn.apply(this, args);

        // at the key args, store the result we just created
        cache[args] = result;

        // send the result
        return result;

    }

}

fib = memoize(slowFib);

console.log(fib(15));


```

Run our badly optimized function through memoize to get way better performances.
