This article was done using my notes from Stephen Grider's amazing course on algorithms and data structures, available at : https://www.rallycoding.com/

## Genetarors

### Our first simple example

Let's take a look at this simple piece of code. Function generator uses \* to initialize.

```
function* numbers() {

    const result = 1 + 1;

    return 20 + (yield result);

}

const generator = numbers();

generator; // It returns : Object [Generator] {}

generator.next(); // It returns : { value: 2, done: false }

generator.next(10) // It returns : { value: 30, done: true }

```

Whenever we call numbers(), it returns a generator object: Object [Generator] {}. When we call generator.next(), the code will execute until a yield value is found : { value: 2, done: false }. When yield is found, execution of the function is paused.

The first time I called next(), the function executes until the yield statement and automatically returns whatever was yielded. When I make the second call with a value, it magically replaces the (yield result) portion, that is why we get value: 30.

### Our second example

```
function* list() {

  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
  yield 4;

}

const generator = list();

generator.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }
generator.next(); // { value: 2, done: false }
generator.next(); // { value: 3, done: false }
generator.next(); // { value: 4, done: false }
generator.next(); // { value: undefined, done: true }

```

Whenever I call generator.next(), it will execute our list() function. On the first call it will return the first yield, on the second call the following yield, etc... .
At the very end, if I have neither yield nor return statements, I will get : { value: undefined, done: true }. Thinking about it, I might not be a terrible thing to call generator.next() more than we need to in a development environment.

The idea is that we can use multiple yield statements inside a single genetaror. But why would we want to do this ? Let's push out example a bit further.

```
function* list() {

  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
  yield 4;

}

const generator = list();

const numbers = [];

for (let value of generator) {

  numbers.push(value);

}

numbers; // It rturns : [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]


```

So, here you see, we can iterate through a generator and for each yield statement our for-loop will execute one time. With 4 yield statements, our loop runs 4 times.

### Nested generators ? Look at our third example

```
function* numbers() {

  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield* moreNumbers();
  yield 6;
  yield 7;

}

function* moreNumbers() {

  yield 3;
  yield 4;
  yield 5;
}

const generator = numbers();

const values = [];

for (let value of generator) {

  values.push(value);
}

values; // It returns [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ];
```

We can observe another feature of genetarors. We can nest generators to delegate behaviors. Calling numbers(), we went from yield 1, yield 2 to yield\*. yield\* specifically means we are about to call a new generator.

### Our fourth example on a typical Tree

Our objective is to create a typical computer science tree and iterate through all the nodes of the tree and step through it.

```
class Tree {
  constructor(value = null, children = []) {

    this.value = value;

    this.children = children;

  }

  *printValues() {

    yield this.value;

    for (let child of this.children) {

    // here is a use of recursive generators
      yield* child.printValues();

    }

  }

}

const tree = new Tree(1, [new Tree(2, [new Tree(4)]), new Tree(3)]);

// we pass the generator directly
for (let value of tree.printValues()) {

  values.push(value);

}

values; // [ 1, 2, 4, 3 ]

```

On calling \*printValues() on a single node in the tree, I will first yield the node value (yield this.value);.
The next time, I call next on it, I will enter our for-loop and delegate to other generators (yield\* child.printValues()).
For each child of the top node, I will walk through its children and call printValues(). Finally, on calling values, we get [ 1, 2, 4, 3 ].
