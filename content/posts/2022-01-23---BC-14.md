## Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of defining a domain with the right amount of information that conveys enough meaning, but not too much meaning either. Too much meaning would make the whole abstraction less relevant.

If you think of Facebook, engineers have modeled the social network around four entities: 
Users, Friends, Posts, and Likes. If you we were to model this application, what data model would we use ? What level of abstraction would we pick ?

## Relational model

Relational model is the traditional way of defining a data model. In a typical relational database, this will likely be modeled using four different tables: **users**, **posts**, **friends**, and **likes**.

Important element to highlight is that our model would make us write a relational query like the one below. Indeed it allows to query data across multiple tables.

## Document based model

Document based model allows to define our models using document stores.

We have users and posts represented in simple JSON format. If you want to access all the likes of a given post, this query is fairly simple as within a post you can access the array of its likes. However in our case, we wish to query our friends likes, which is not available through the database query language. Such a query will have to be replicated at the application level. You will have to do multiple queries and do joins at the application layer in memory.

## Graph based model

A graph database uses graph structures with nodes, edges to represent data (Bourbakis, 1998). The graph relates the data items in the store to a collection of nodes and edges, the edges representing the relationships between the nodes.

In such a representation, querying becomes way more intuitive. Looking for our friends likes, a query could look like this:

## Data Storage and Data Retrieval

We just saw 3 data models: 
1. Relational model
2. Document model
3. Graph model

Each of these models have a different complexity on querying it. Data modeling and data querying go hand in hand. There is no one size that fits all. Your application use case will determine what works best, what query language are you going to use with it.

Data Storage and Data Retrieval are the two main things to consider. Same query can be either written in 4 lines or with 30 lines based on your data model!

## Main categories of databases

**Relational Database**
1. Optimized for transactions and batch processing (read throughput)
2. Data organized as table/relations
3. Object Relational Mapping needed

Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL.

**Document Database**
1. NoSQL
2. Flexible schemas, better performance due to high write throughut
3. Open Source

Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB.

Document databases target use cases where data comes in self-constrained documents and relationships between one document and another are rare.

**Graph Database**
1. Best suited for highly interconnected data - many to many relationships

Examples: Neo4j AnzoGraph, SPARQL.

Graph databases go in the opposite direction, targeting use cases where anything is potentially related to everything.
