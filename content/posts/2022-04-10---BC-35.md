## Pattern: Database Wrapping Service

With this pattern, we hide the database behind a service that acts as a thin wrapper, moving dataabase dependencies to become service dependencies.

Ultimately you can encourage teams to split ownership and consider main data source as someone else's, and encourage them to store their own data locally.

This pattern works really well where the underlying schema is too hard to consider pulling apart. By placing a wrapper around the schema, and making it clear that the data can be accessed only through that schema, you at the very least can put a brake on the database growing any further.
