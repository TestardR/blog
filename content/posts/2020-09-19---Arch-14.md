### The n-tiered architecture style.

The layered architecture, also known as the n-tiered architecture style, is
one of the most common architecture styles. This style of architecture is the
de facto standard for most applications, primarily because of its simplicity,
familiarity, and low cost.

Components within the layered architecture style are organized into logical
horizontal layers. Although there are no specific restrictions in terms of the number and types of layers that must exist, most layered architectures consist of four standard layers:
presentation, business, persistence, and database.

Each layer of the layered architecture style has a specific role and
responsibility within the architecture. For example, the presentation layer
would be responsible for handling all user interface and browser
communication logic, whereas the business layer would be responsible for
executing specific business rules associated with the request.

This separation of concerns concept within the layered architecture style makes it easy to build effective roles and responsibility models within the
architecture. Components within a specific layer are limited in scope,
dealing only with the logic that pertains to that layer.

The layered architecture is a technically partitioned architecture (as
opposed to a domain-partitioned architecture). Groups of components,
rather than being grouped by domain (such as customer), are grouped by
their technical role in the architecture (such as presentation or business).

### Layers of Isolation

Each layer in the layered architecture style can be either closed or open. A
closed layer means that as a request moves top-down from layer to layer,
the request cannot skip any layers, but rather must go through the layer
immediately below it to get to the next layer.

The layers of isolation concept means that changes made in one layer of the
architecture generally don’t impact or affect components in other layers,
providing the contracts between those layers remain unchanged. 

To support layers of isolation, layers involved with the major flow of the request
necessarily have to be closed. If the presentation layer can directly access
the persistence layer, then changes made to the persistence layer would
impact both the business layer and the presentation layer, producing a very
tightly coupled application with layer interdependencies between
components.

The layers of isolation concept also allows any layer in the architecture to
be replaced without impacting any other layer.

### Adding Layers

While closed layers facilitate layers of isolation and therefore help isolate
change within the architecture, there are times when it makes sense for
certain layers to be open. 

For example, suppose there are shared objects
within the business layer that contain common functionality for business
components (such as date and string utility classes, auditing classes, logging
classes, and so on).

One way to architecturally mandate this restriction is to add to the
architecture a new services layer containing all of the shared business
objects. However, the new services layer must be
marked as open; otherwise the business layer would be forced to go through
the services layer to access the persistence layer.

### What to take away from this style of archictecture ?

#### 1. Low cost and simple 

Overall cost and simplicity are the primary strengths of the layered
architecture style. Being monolithic in nature, layered architectures don’t
have the complexities associated with distributed architecture styles, are
simple and easy to understand, and are relatively low cost to build and
maintain.

#### 2. Low deployability and testability

Deployability rates low due to the ceremony of deployment (effort to
deploy), high risk, and lack of frequent deployments. A simple three-line
change to a class file in the layered architecture style requires the entire
deployment unit to be redeployed.

The low testability rating also reflects this scenario; with a simple three-line change,
most developers are not going to spend hours executing the entire
regression test suite.

#### 3. Average reliability

Average reliability is mostly due to the lack of network traffic, bandwidth, and latency found in
most distributed architectures.

#### 4. Low scalability

The poor scalability is primarily due to to monolithic deployments and the lack of
architectural modularity. Although it is possible to make certain functions
within a monolith scale more than others, this effort usually requires very
complex design techniques (multithreading, parallel processing, etc...).

#### 5. Low performance

Like scalability, performance can be addressed through caching, multithreading,
and the like, but it is not a natural characteristic of this architecture style;
architects and developers have to work hard to make all this happen.

#### 6. Low tolerance

Layered architectures don’t support fault tolerance due to monolithic
deployments and the lack of architectural modularity. If one small part of a
layered architecture causes an out-of-memory condition to occur, the entire
application unit is impacted and crashes.
