## Batch processing

According to Shiff (2022), "Batch processing is the processing of a large volume of data all at once. The data easily consists of millions of records for a day and can be stored in a variety of ways (file, record, etc). The jobs are typically completed simultaneously in non-stop, sequential order."

### MapReduce

MapReduce is one of the most important concepts for batch processing. MapReduce is programming model:

1. Map function transforms the piece of data into key-value pairs and then the keys are sorted,
2. Reduce function is applied to merge the values based on the key into a single output.

In a distributed system, MapReduce gives you the ability to have a filter step and then a summarize step of data. The main framework in the industry for MapReduce is offered by [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/).

### Beyond MapReduce

[PIG and Hive](https://www.projectpro.io/article/difference-between-pig-and-hive-the-two-key-components-of-hadoop-ecosystem/79#:~:text=Hive%20Query%20language%20(HiveQL)%20suits,for%20those%20who%20know%20SQL.) are built on top of MapReduce to offers a higher level of abstraction for all kind of users to only worry about the data flow.

[Spark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark) focuses on enhancing MapReduce efficiency.
