This article was done using my notes from Sudheer Jonna, 2020, [React Interview Questions & Answers](https://github.com/sudheerj/reactjs-interview-questions#what-is-react).

## What is React ?

React is an open-source frontend JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces especially for single page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

## What are the major features of React ?

The major features of React are:

1. It uses VirtualDOM instead RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive,
2. Supports server-side rendering,
3. Follows Unidirectional data flow or data binding,
4. Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.
