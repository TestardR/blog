This article was done using my notes from Tapir Liu, Go 101 (v1.14) and Caleb Doxsey, Introducing Go (2016).

## Pointers

Pointers reference a location in memory where a value is stored rather than the value itself. In Go, a pointer is represented using an askterisk (*) followed by the type of the stored value. In the zero function, xPtr is a pointer to an int. 

```
package main

import "fmt"

func zero(xPtr *int) {
	*xPtr = 0
}

func main() {
	x := 5
	zero(&x)
	fmt.Println(x) // 0
}
```

When we write, ***xPtr = 0**, we are saying, "store the int 0 in the memory location **x** refers to". Finally, we use the **&** operator to find the address of a variable. **&x** returns a *int (pointer to an int) because x is an int. This is what allows us to modify the original variable. **&x** in main() and Xptr in zero() refer to the same memory location.

### Why do we need pointers ? 

In Go, all value assignments, including function argument passing, are value copying. 

For instance: 

```
package main

import "fmt"

func double(x int) {
	x += x
}

func main() {
	a := 3
	double(3)
	fmt.Println(a) // 3
}

```
In short, pointers provide indirect ways to access some values. 

```
package main

import "fmt"

func double(x *int) {
	*x += *x
}

func main() {
	a := 3
	double(&a) // address in memory
	fmt.Println(a) // 6
    fmt.Println()
}

```
