This article was done using my notes from Stephen Grider's amazing course on algorithms and data structures, available at : https://www.rallycoding.com/

## The Stack

Create a stack data structure. Think of a stack as a pile of rings that you would add one on top of the other.
The stack should be a class with methods 'push', 'pop', and 'peek'. Adding an element to the stack should store it until it is removed.

For example:<br>

const s = new Stack();<br>
s.push(1);<br>
s.push(2);<br>
s.pop(); // returns 2<br>
s.pop(); // returns 1

```
class Stack {

    constructor() {

        this.data = [];

    }

    // here is the big difference with a Queue, a Stack will add at the end
    push(record) {

        this.data.push(record);

    }

    pop() {

        return this.data.pop();

    }

    peek() {

        return this.data[this.data.length - 1];

    }

}
```

## a Queue from Stacks

Implement a Queue datastructure using two stacks. _Do not_ create an array inside of the 'Queue' class.
Queue should implement the methods 'add', 'remove', and 'peek'. For a reminder on what each method does, look back
at the previous article on Queues.

For example:<br>
const q = new Queue();<br>
q.add(1);<br>
q.add(2);<br>
q.peek(); // returns 1<br>
q.remove(); // returns 1<br>
q.remove(); // returns 2<br>

On this one, I really advise you to draw what is going on. I will be easier to make sense of the flow of data.

```
class Queue {
  constructor() {
    this.stackOne = new Stack();
    this.stackTwo = new Stack();
  }

  remove() {

    while (this.stackeOne.peek()) {

      this.stackTwo.push(this.stackOne.pop());

    }

    const record = this.stackTwo.pop();

    while (this.stackTwo.peek()) {

      this.stackOne.push(this.stackTwo.pop());

    }

    return record;

  }

  add(record) {

    this.stackOne.push(record);

  }

  peek() {

    while (this.stackeOne.peek()) {

      this.stackTwo.push(this.stackOne.pop());

    }

    const record = this.stackTwo.peek();

    while (this.stackTwo.peek()) {

      this.stackOne.push(this.stackTwo.pop());

    }

    return record
    
  }
  
}
```
