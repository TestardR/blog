## How to choose a database ?

Every storage engine is optimized for different use cases. Select the right storage engine for your use case. As an application developer, we need to have a rough idea on what the storage engine is doing under the hood so that we can select the right one.

## Two broad categories: OLTP - OLAP

There are two broad categories of databases: **OLTP** and **OLAP** each with different read pattern, write patterns, user using it, data size etc.

**OLTP** stands for Online Transaction Processing database, they are optimized for latency. 
E.g. MySQL, Oracle. 

**OLAP** stands Online Analytical Processing databases, they are optimized for data crunching in analytical systems.
E.g. Hbase, Hive, Spark.

## row-store versus column-store

Typically, OLTP is a row base system store, where it stores related entities together in row fashion. It is easy to add and modify a record. However you might read unnecessary data. The end user of such OLTP databases, row based system, is the actual customer. In typical row stores, reads should be megabytes and at most gigabytes.

Column-store offers stronger data segregation. Data is stored in column by entity. It gives the ability to only read relevant data. It is better suited for read-mostly, read-intensive applications. This kind of OLAP system is primarily designed for data analytics engineers. In column stores, reads could go reach gigabytes and terabytes.

## ETL: Extraction, Transformation, Loading

Typically for an OLAP system, there is an Extract, Transform, and Load. At the Extract stage, you could find OLTP potential systems pushing data to a Transform stage, where it converts the data to a query optimized data warehouse. The last Load stage is where the actual OLAP lies.

## Database index

An Index is an additional structure that is derived from the primary data. It is usually a self-balancing B-tree data structure, which keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. However, writes could also be slower since the index also needs to be updated. A simple database index is a Hash based Index.
