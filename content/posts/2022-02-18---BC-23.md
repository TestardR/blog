## Stream processing

Stream Processing are used for near real-time applications, insights, or alerting. 
Examples cover:
1. Fraud detection,
2. Analytics - trends,
3. Anomaly detection,
4. Stock market trades.

### Stream system architecture

At a high level, stream processing works as a broker receiving events from a producer and pushing these events to consumers.

At a lower level, this is where a stream processing service could fit in.

### Important concepts

Comparing different solutions for stream processing (Storm, Flint, Samza, Spark), you want to pay attention to: latency, throughput, ordering, backpressure, elasticity (scaling), state management, strictness of delivery. 

With stream processing solutions, we move away from querying / polling a database to get information. We set up a data pipeline that will trigger notificiations. Conceptually, it is significant.

Event Streaming allows for multiple views of the same data.
