This article was done using my notes from Caleb Doxsey (2012) and Mark McGanaghan (2020).

## Channels

According to Mark McGanaghan (2020), Channels are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines. You can send values into channels from one goroutine and receive those values into another goroutine.

See the following code: 
```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

    messages := make(chan string)

    go func() { messages <- "ping" }()

    msg := <-messages

    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```
Running go run channels.go. The output would be: 
```
ping
```

A channel type is represented by the keyword **chan** followed by the type that will be passed in the channel. The **<--** operator is used to send and receive messages on the channel. Here, **messages <-- "ping"** means send **"ping"**. **msg := <-- messages** means receive a message and store in **messages**. The **fmt** could have been written like this **fmt.Println(<-messages)**.

## Synchronizing channels

According to Caleb Doxsey, channels provide a way for goroutines to communicate and synchronize their execution. He offers the following code:

```
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "time"
)

func pinger(c chan string) {
  for i := 0; ; i++ {
    c <- "ping"
  }
}

func printer(c chan string) {
  for {
    msg := <- c
    fmt.Println(msg)
    time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
  }
}

func main() {
  var c chan string = make(chan string)

  go pinger(c)
  go printer(c)

  var input string
  fmt.Scanln(&input)
}
```
Now let's take a look at this example. This program prints **"ping"** forever.  
Similarly here, **c <- "ping"** means send **"ping"**. **msg := <- c** means receive a message and store it in **msg**. 

The interesting thing is that using a channel like this synchronizes the two goroutines ! 
When pinger attempts to send a message on the channel it will wait until printer is ready to receive the message. (this is known as blocking) 

## Let's follow Caleb Doxsey and go down the rabbit hole.

Let's add a sender function to the program and modify our main function. 

```
func ponger(c chan string) {
  for i := 0; ; i++ {
    c <- "pong"
  }
}

func main() {
  var c chan string = make(chan string)

  go pinger(c)
  go ponger(c)
  go printer(c)

  var input string
  fmt.Scanln(&input)
}
```

The program will now take turns printing “ping” and “pong”. 
How interesting ! It just made my day.
