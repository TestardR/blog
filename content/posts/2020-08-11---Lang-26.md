This article was done using my notes from Caleb Doxsey, Introducing Go (2016).

## Structs

A struct is a type that contains names fields. For example, we could represent a vehicle like this:

```
type Vehicle struct {
	wheels int
	gears int
    brand string
}
```

Fields are a set of grouped variables. Like functions, we can collapse fields that have the same type.

```
type Vehicle struct {
	wheels, gears int
	brand string
}
```

## Initialization

We could define a Vehicle without giving it values for each fields, but it is quite uncommon. Rather, we would initialize a vehicle in two ways:

```
v := Vehicle{wheels: 4, gears: 6, brand: "Chrysler"}
```

or

```
v := Vehicle{4, 6, "Chrysler"}
```

Creating a instance of the Vehicle struct allocates memory for all the fields. It returns a pointer to the struct (\*Vehicle). Pointers are often used with structs so that functions can modify their contents.

If you want a pointer to the struct, use &:

```
v: = &Vehicle{4, 6, "Chrysler"}
```

## Fields

We can access fields using the . operator:

```
fmt.Println(v.wheels, v.gears, v.brand)
```

Let's create a function making use of a Vehicle:

```
func describe(v Vehicle) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("This %s has %d and uses %d", v.brand, v.wheels, v.gears)
}
```

If you want to modify fields, you would typically write a function using a pointer to the Vehicle:

```
func downgrade(v *Vehicle) string {
	v.brand = "Renault"
	v.gears = 5

	return fmt.Sprintf("This %s has %d and uses %d", v.brand, v.wheels, v.gears)
}
```

You would have called the function giving it the address in memory to the Vehicle.

```
downgrade(&v)
```

## Methods

We can improve significantly our code by using a special type of function known as **method**.

```
func (v *Vehicle) futherDowngrade() string {
	v.brand = "Fiat"
	v.gears = 4

	return fmt.Sprintf("This %s has %d and uses %d", v.brand, v.wheels, v.gears)
}
```

In between the keyword func and the name of the function, we have added a **receiver**.
The receiver allows us to call the function on the Vehicle instance using the . operator.

```
v.furtherDowngrade()
```

We no longer need the & operator as Go automatically knows to pass a pointer to the vehicle for this method.
