This article was done using my notes from Sean Maxwell, 2018, "The JavaScript Object Paradigm and Prototypes Explained Simply".

## Object Overview

Objects at the most basic level can be thought of a list of key/value pairs with the key always being a string and the value whatever you want. It is known as **map** in other languages. Everything that you type in JavaScript that is not a primitive is an object.

Objects have “properties”. This refers to a specific key/value pair on an object. To give you an idea of what objects look like, we’ll start off with a simple example of an object with two properties: age and weight.

### Functions are Objects

Since functions are objects they are often referred to as function-objects. A function-object is a special group of key/value pairs with specific properties for executing code and passing down values.

You could say that function-objects have two primary purposes. If we want to create a chuck of logic that executes, we can use a function-object: just like “methods” in any other programming language. If we want to create objects with both values and methods, and perhaps some logic to set those values, we would also use function-objects.

In the standard case, functions in JavaScript look like functions in any other language; they execute a chunk logic to perform a specific task. In the following snippet, bark is function-object executing code.

```
function Dog(age, weight) {

  this.species = 'Hulky';

  this.age = age;

  this.weight = weight;

  this.bark = bark;

}

function bark() {

  console.log('woof woof');

}

var Spot = new Dog(8, 65);
var Bingo = new Dog(10, 70);

Spot.species; // 'Hulsky'

Bingo.bark(); // 'Woof woof'
```

## Objects vs Prototypes

You’ve often heard that JavaScript is a prototype-based language. "Prototypes are a special type of object and exist as a property on function-objects."
When we try to access a **key** on a function-object, JavaScript will look at its prototype property to see if it’s there. If not it will go up the **prototype-chain** to try to find it. To understand the **prototype-chain**, we need to learn about **functions** and **inheritance**.

### Functions and Inheritance

Whenever an instance-object is returned from a function call using **new**, it is given a property with the key **proto**. The value of this property is the prototype property of the function that created it.

```
Bingo.__proto__ === Dog.prototype

Spot.__proto__ === Dog.prototype
```

If we try to access a property on an instance-object and it’s not there, JavaScript will first go to **proto** and see if it’s on the parent function’s prototype. To see this in action, let’s set a property on the prototype key for our Dog object and when we call Spot['the property'] or Bingo['the property'] we’ll get that same value. This will work even after both dog instance-objects have been created.

```
Dog.prototype.bark = function() {

    console.log('woof woof')

}

Spot.bark() // 'woof woof'

Bingo.bark() // 'woof woof'
```

### Deeper into inheritance

JavaScript inheritance is the Object keyword, which is a function-object. All instance-objects inherit from it. When we create an object-literal, JavaScript under the hood is actually calling new Object(). The new object’s **proto** will point to Object’s prototype. So all objects made from object-literals are actually instance-objects of Object. This provides us with a lot of useful methods like hasOwnProperty, which can tell us if a property exists on an object. If we try to access a property directly on a function-object, JavaScript will look at prototype first and then move up the chain using **proto** on the prototype.

Let’s look at a couple of examples of JavaScript moving up the prototype-chain to access **hasOwnProperty** on some objects.

Object-literal:

```
var insect = {legs: 6}//

insect.__proto__ === Object.prototype // true

insect.hasOwnProperty === Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty // true

insect.hasOwnProperty('legs') // true
```

Instance-Object:

```
function Foo() {

    this.something = 'Bar'

}

Foo.prototype.__proto__ === Object.prototype //

Foo.hasOwnProperty('name') // true

Foo.hasOwnProperty('something') // false, set on instance-object not on the function
```

### What about the **proto** of Function-Objects?

JavaScript actually has a built-in function-object called Function. Every function’s **proto** property points to Function.prototype, which is a function but does not have the prototype property and returns undefined. Function.prototype defines the default behavior that all functions inherit from. Like all prototype properties of function-objects, it still has**proto** which points to Object.prototype.

```
Dog.__proto__ === Function.prototype // true

Object.__proto__ === Function.prototype // true

Function.__proto__ === Function.prototype // true

Function.prototype.__proto__ === Object.prototype // true
```

### Multi-Level Inheritance

When we say inheritance we typically think of instance-objects returned from functions. With prototype you can also do multiple levels of inheritance and have function-objects inherit from other function-objects. All you have to do is set the child function-object’s prototype to another instance of the parent function-object’s prototype. Then all properties of the parent will be copied. If the parent function receives arguments, such as age and weight in Dog, use .call to set the this property for the child-object.

Labrador inherits from Dog:

```
function Dog(age, weight) {

  this.age = age;

  this.weight = weight;

  this.bark = bark;

}

function bark() {

  console.log('woof woof');

}


function Labrador(furColor, age, weight) {

    this.furColor = furColor

    this.breed = 'labrador'

    Dog.call(this, age, weight)

}

Labrador.prototype = Object.create(Dog.prototype)

var Fido = new Labrador('white', 4, 41)

Fido.bark() // 'woof wook'
```

### Classes

Classes in JavaScript, which were created for ES6, are just syntax sugar on top of function-objects. Instead of having to type prototype over-and-over again to define methods on functions, with the class keyword we can just define a group of methods inside of a class. With the extends keyword, classes can inherit from other classes without having to do **Object.create** and **Object.call**

Same code as above, but using ES6 classes:

```
class Dog {

    constructor(age, weight) {

        this.age = age

        this.weight = weight

    }

    bark() {

        console.log('woof woof')

    }

}

class Labrador extends Dog {

    constructor(furColor, age, weight) {

        super(age, weight)

        this.furColor = furColor

        this.breed = 'labrador'

    }

}


var Fido = new Labrador('white', 12, 100);

Fido.bark(); // 'wook woof'

```
