I have experience in **creating integration, distributed event driven backend solutions, and serverless architecture**.

The primary languages, technologies and platforms I have experience with are: **Golang, Python, TypeScript, AWS, Kafka, and Datadog** that were used in **eCommerce, logistics, and finance sectors**.

My languages of choice for configuration and infrastructure as a code is **Terraform**.

Nowadays I am trying to continuously grow on **the technical side** while also trying to **bring positive customer impact** through the solutions I and my team build.

In my early professional career, I have worked as an **Economics Teacher**. 
It gave me a great sense of communication as well as tools to lead teams.

Speaking of, this bio would not be complete without mentioning my life work for the past 17 years 
as a dancer.
