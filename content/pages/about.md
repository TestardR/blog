Overall, I have genuine passion for **architecture designs** and **engineering management**.
Having experience, as both a **Backend and Frontend Engineer** with a **DevOps** mindset, I have a comprehensive understanding of microservice architectures and teams organization to produce them. 

Before becoming a **Software Engineer**, I have worked as an **Economics Teacher**. 
It gave me a great sense of communication as well as tools to lead teams.

Speaking of, this bio would not be complete without mentioning my life work for the past 16 years 
as a dancer. I surely consider myself as an **artist**.
